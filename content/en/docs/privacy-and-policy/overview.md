Terms & Conditions:
Decibling will stay out of any legal conflicts of ownership and any litigation disputes that arise between the artists and a third party related to ownership that are caused by either party (artists or third party) for not being honest from the start (at the time of account creation).

Decibling will "be on side" with the winners "of the legal conflicts" after any litigation circumstance between the artist and a third party, and Decibling will take  appropriate actions to punish the party who caused the damage.
