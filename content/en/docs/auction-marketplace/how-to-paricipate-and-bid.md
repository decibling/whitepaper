# Who can bid?
- All Listener Accounts can bid on any auction.
- All Collector Accounts can bid on any auction except their owned auction.
- Artist can not bid on their owned auction.
- An Artist Account can be a Collector Account too, if they want.

# The Seller
- After opening an NFT auction successfully, the Artist whom is the owner of this NFT auction, is known as the seller. The collector whom is the owner of this NFT auction, is known as the re-seller.
- Seller or re-seller must set the opening price.
- Seller or re-seller must set the time bidding as Starting time and Ending time.
- Seller or re-seller must pay 10% income tax on every successful auction:

 			            Income Tax = 0.1 * Final winning bid amount 
- Seller must pay 2.5% Decibling Award fee (DCBA fee) on every successful auction:

			            DCBA Fee = 0.025 * Final winning bid amount
- If the NFT is sold from the 2nd auction of it, the re-seller will lose the rights and obligations for the DCB Award. The Artist Account which is the first seller, never lose his/ her/ their rights and obligations for this.

- Again, if the NFT is sold from the 2nd auction of it, the 2nd to n re-seller won't receive the 2.5% DBCA fee from the winning buyer. 
# The Buyer
- Every Listener Account or Collector Account which is joining the bid, is known as the buyer.

- The buyer who wins the auction, will be received a suggested email of paying 2.5% of the final winning bid amount for DCBA fee. If this buyer accepts to pay, he/ she/ they will have the rights and obligations to share the DCB Award with the artist. If this final buyer doesn't, he/ she/ they won't have it and 100% prizes of DCBA will go to the artist.
# The Cost & The Profit

Seller:

            Seller Net Profit = Final winning bid amount - (Income Tax + DCBA Fee)

Re-seller:

		        Re-seller Net Profit = Final winning bid amount - Income Tax

Winning Buyer:

			        Winning Buyer Payment = Final winning bid amount


Default income tax: 10%
