- Artist can not bid on their owned auction.
- An Artist Account can be a Collector Account too, if they want.

# The Seller
- After opening an NFT auction successfully, the Artist whom is the owner of this NFT auction, is known as the seller. The collector whom is the owner of this NFT auction, is known as the re-seller.
- Seller or re-seller must set the opening price.
- Seller or re-seller must set the time bidding as Starting time and Ending time.

# The Buyer

Every Listener Account or Collector Account which is joining the bid, is known as the buyer.
