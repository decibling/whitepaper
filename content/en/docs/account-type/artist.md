Artist Account: An Artist Account is defined as any account that uploads at least three of his or her own songs while adhering to the terms and conditions of our Terms and Conditions.

Every successful Artist Account creation will have its own Artist Pool, and the artist can then begin holding auctions and inviting his/her/their fans to stake in his/her/their Pool.

Artist can not bid on their owned auction.
