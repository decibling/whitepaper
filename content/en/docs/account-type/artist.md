Artist Account: An Artist Account is defined as any account that uploads at least three of his/her/their owned songs while adhering to the terms and conditions of our Terms and Conditions.

Every successful Artist Account creation will have its owned Artist Pool, and the account can then mint music-work to NFT then begin holding any NFT auction and inviting his/her/their fans to stake in his/her/their Pool.

Artist can not bid on their owned auction.
