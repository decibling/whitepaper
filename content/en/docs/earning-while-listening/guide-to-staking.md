Users will use the token which is issued by Decibling (FROY) to stake into the pools from their wallets.

Users can choose one of two Pool Types to stake their FROY into. Or users can choose both.

The Artist (owner) of the Artist Pool can also stake FROY into his/her/their owned pool.

The higher the staking volume of FROY, the bigger the return amount.
