Depending on the level of development, user can get FROY in different ways on each cycle.
Here, we are talking about the first phase, when the Decibling platform begin to run, we decided to use the network of ETH (Ethereum). So you can get FROY through DEXs (Decentralized exchanges) in the ETH network.
Pair of currency in first stage: FROY/ETH & ETH/FROY

Depending on each phase, users will have to pay gas fee in different ways.

For the first phase, when Decibing’s platform runs on ETH’s network, all gas fees will be charged in ETH, or with an equivalent exchange rate option.
