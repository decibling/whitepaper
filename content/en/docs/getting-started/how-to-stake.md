### Decibling Pool

> By default, you will be able to listen to all musics after registration but at low quality.
> To get better quality, stake 300 FROY to Decibling and you will be upgraded to medium quality.

If you start from our homepage, this promotion will lead through our upgrade system.

Our first requirement is just stake 300 FROY to our pool, then you are good to go!

You can check quality between low and medium in the player:

In the artist page, you will see a button to stake in the right side. Click on the button then input any amount you want. That's it!
