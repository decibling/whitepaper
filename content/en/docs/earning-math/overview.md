## Biddings
**Default settings:**
* Default Income Tax: 10%
* Artist DCBA fee: 2.5%
* Buyer DCBA fee: 2.5%

First sale:
* Artist listed any NFT for an auction with the opening bid as 1,000 FROY
* Buyer won at 10,000 FROY

Settle bid on first sale:
* Buyer pays the full amount of his/her/their winning bid = 10,000 FROY
* Artist receives 100% - (10% + 2.5%) = 87.5% = 10,000 * 87.5% = 8,750 FROY
* Artist pays DCBA fee as 2.5% = 250 FROY
* Artist pays Income Tax as 10% = 1000 FROY

Second sale:
* Reseller listed any NFT for an auction with the opening bid as 15,000 FROY
* Buyer won at 100,000 FROY

Settle bid on second sale:
* Buyer pays the full amount of his/her/their winning bid = 100,000 FROY
* Reseller receives 100% - (10%) = 90% = 100,000 * 90% = 90,000 FROY
* Reseller pays Income Tax as 10% = 10,000 FROY

## Staking
### Default pool
**Default settings:**
* 2% return for stakers = R
* 5% platform fees = F
* 365 days in a year = Y
* Pay cycle: 5 days

The shortened formula for every day is: R / (100 * Y) = 2 / (100 * 365) = 5.47945E-05 = K

Let the staked amount is 100,000 FROY

The total profit would be: P = 100,000 * K * 5 = 27.39726027
* Estimated profit will be received: P * 0.95 = 26.02739726 FROY
* Estimated Platform fee = P * 0.05 = 1.369863014 FROY
> The profit will be calculated correctly when you submit on our smart contracts.
