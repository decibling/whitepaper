Depletion ?
Based on the non-inflationary mechanism and progressive over the return payment period, the depletion of the guarantee fund is likely to occur.


Reverse pump plan for anti-depletion::
Every 3 years, Decibling will plan to inject a standard level into the guarantee fund with the following revenue sources:

* Community system maintenance fee (0.5% per year on artirst’s return and artist pool stakers’s return)
* Fees collected from advertising
* Fees from data extended for Asset Storage
* Develop a private blockchain to optimize the revenue from gas fees.
* Environment and  Academy Fee: 2,5% each (artist & collector) for each successful  transaction..
* ... More in the future
