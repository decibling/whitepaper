> Decibling is a Web3 platform with philosophy of Earning Return (payment interest) while listening to music and also a marketplace for trading works of art  in NFT format.

We establish a music player platform in the form of staking into music Pools by using the POS mechanism (Proof of Stake), and as a result, it brings Return to both Listeners and Pool owners.

In addition, we establish a trading market. In specific, an auction market for artist's artworks being trade with Decibling's NFT mechanism.
